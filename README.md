## JS Equality Jackpot

Roll for a (surprisingly small) chance to see some weirdness : http://js-equality-jackpot.surge.sh/

## Run locally

Clone repo, then

```
cd js-equality-jackpot
npm install
npm start
```

## Todo

- ~Make it a game (hide true / false evaluation and let the user guess)~
- ~Remake the layout so that it is properly responsive (not with weird hacks like currently)~ Eh, it's ok now I guess
- Implement basic leaderboard, pinball style
- Add more weird cases
- Add tests (learn `react-testing-library` ?)
